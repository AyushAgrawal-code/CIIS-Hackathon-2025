Hackathon 2025 Submission – Team *Cyber Monks*

## 🚀 Overview  
BankShield AI is a prototype solution designed to **detect fake banking apps, flag suspicious transactions, trace laundering networks, and provide evidence to cyber police**.  

This repository contains a **frontend-only prototype (HTML, CSS, JS)** that demonstrates the workflow and features visually.  
It is meant to **showcase the concept** of our system with a clean UI and simulated detection logic.

  - Upload an APK file (simulated check).  
  - Fake apps flagged with ❌, safe apps marked ✅.  
  - Permissions risk table (color-coded).  
  - Proactive alert to cyber department + blocklist entry.  

- **Suspicious Transaction Analysis**  
  - Upload CSV / Use demo data.

    2. Fraudulent transaction flagged  
    3. Laundering traced
